# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** designed for the comprehensive analysis of heart disease clinical data. The dashboard offers an in-depth view of key health metrics, survival rates, and patient demographics to help identify patterns and potential risk factors.

---

## Features

- **Survival Rate Analysis**  
  Clear overview of the overall survival rate with a detailed breakdown by age group.

- **Patient Demographics**  
  Distribution of patients based on age group and gender (Male/Female).

- **Key Health Indicators**
  - **Serum Creatinine** – Survival counts and average serum creatinine levels across different age groups.
  - **Ejection Fraction** – Number of death events and average ejection fraction, segmented by age group.

- **Risk Factor Impact**  
  Visualization of the impact and distribution of major risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure (BP), anemia, and diabetes across various age groups.

- **Interactive Visuals**  
  Includes line charts, bar charts, and area charts for a dynamic analytical experience.

## Data

The analysis is based on a dataset of heart disease clinical records, containing:
- Patient information
- Health metrics (e.g., age, serum creatinine, ejection fraction)
- Final outcome (death event)

---

## Technologies

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and calculated columns to derive metrics like `Survival_rate` and `Age_Group`

## Getting Started

1. Download the **Power BI file** (`.pbix`) from this repository.
2. Open the file using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the interactive dashboard.
